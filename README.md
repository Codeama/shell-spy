_Disclaimer_: This is a learning project I did with the guidance of [@bitfield](https://github.com/bitfield)

## Description
A shell spy or recorder that helps you keep records of your shell commands and the output in a file.

You can run it to execute normal shell commands or use the spy.go package to create yours. Each new Session can be customised with colours from the faith package and you can set preferred prompt.


### CLI
Have a play with the CLI by running:
``` bash
go run cmd/main.go
```
